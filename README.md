# Quick-setup 

#### Once you have successfully setup this template and initial database, the view will look like this:

### Initial Set-up steps

1. Go to your source directory in your terminal and run the command `git clone https://github.com/zhjiang1103/EventonicaWithPost.git <NAMENEWDIRECTORY>`

2. To clean your folder from the owner's git, run the command `rm -rf .git` inside the folder <NAMENEWDIRECTORY>. Then re-initialize as the owner with `git init`.

3. Go to the server folder in the project (`cd server`) and run the command `npm install`

4. Go to the client folder (`cd .. and cd client`) and run the command `npm install`

5. This template has two servers already working. Both servers should start simultaneously, or "concurrently", by running `npm run dev` from within the server directory in your terminal. Please note that your backend server will run from port 8080, and your frontend React server will run from port 3000 .

6. To add a Postgres DB - you will need another terminal window for this part

 Inside your server directory create a `.env` file and copy there the values that are in `.envexample`
